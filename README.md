##Code Description##
#Data acquisition and preprocessing:

1. get_data() function generates simulated data, which can be replaced by actual data acquisition logic.

#Genetic algorithm optimizes trading strategy parameters:#

2.genetic_algorithm() function uses genetic algorithm to optimize trading strategy parameters, and fitness_function() function is used to calculate fitness value.
##Fuzzy logic identifies market status:

3.fuzzy_market_state() function uses fuzzy logic to infer market status (bullish, bearish, neutral).
##Neural network generates trading signals:

4.build_neural_network() function builds neural network, train_neural_network() function trains model, and generate_signal() function generates trading signals.
##Signal generation and risk management:

5.Generate positions based on trading signals, and calculate the total value, positions and cash of the portfolio.
##Performance evaluation:

6.evaluate_performance() function calculates indicators such as annualized return, annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.
##Visualization:

7.Draw time series graphs of total portfolio value, market status and trading signals.
##Model saving:

8.Save the trained neural network model as an HDF5 file.
